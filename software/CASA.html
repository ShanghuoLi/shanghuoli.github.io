		This github provides continuum subtraction program using CASA. 
		This program uses an asymmetric sigma clip algorithm to find line-free channels in 
		the spectrum of the maximum of a data cube. It then uses these channels to produce 
		a continuum subtracted ms and quality assurance continuum images.

		<h3> Some Note for clean </h3>
		Some information from CASA guides. 
		<br>
		For the most effective cleaning, we recommend using a pixel size such that there are 3 - 5 pixels 
		across the synthesized beam. Based on the assumed synthesized beam size of 46 arcsec, 
		we will use a cell (pixel) size of 8 arcsec.
		<br>
		As a general guideline, we recommend image sizes 5x2^nx3^m (n=1,2,..., m=1,2,...) pixels, 
		e.g. 160, 1280 pixels, etc. for improved processing speeds.
