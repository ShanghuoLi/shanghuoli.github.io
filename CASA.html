		<a href="https://casaguides.nrao.edu/index.php?title=Image_Continuum"> Create an Averaged Continuum MS</a>: 
		You can spectrally average the channels together to reduce the size of the continuum ms. 
		The number of channels that you can average together is limited by what is referred to as 
		"bandwidth smearing". You can find the maximum bandwidth each averaged channel can be to 
		avoid bandwidth smearing worse than about 1% in this link.

		<a href="https://github.com/folguinch/GoContinuum"> GoContinuum </a>: 
		This github provides continuum subtraction program using CASA. 
		This program uses an asymmetric sigma clip algorithm to find line-free channels in 
		the spectrum of the maximum of a data cube. It then uses these channels to produce 
		a continuum subtracted ms and quality assurance continuum images.

		<h3> Some Note for clean </h3>
		Some information from CASA guides. 
		<br>
		For the most effective cleaning, we recommend using a pixel size such that there are 3 - 5 pixels 
		across the synthesized beam. Based on the assumed synthesized beam size of 46 arcsec, 
		we will use a cell (pixel) size of 8 arcsec.
		<br>
		As a general guideline, we recommend image sizes 5x2^nx3^m (n=1,2,..., m=1,2,...) pixels, 
		e.g. 160, 1280 pixels, etc. for improved processing speeds.
